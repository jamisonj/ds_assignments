President Thomas S. Monson, beloved prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, shared simple and straightforward messages with the world during the October 2016 general conference in Salt Lake City, Utah.

President Monson spoke of how every man and woman can find happiness and how keeping the commandments of God yields great promises in this life and the next.

Here are five of the things President Monson invited each of us to do to be better and to come closer to God: 

    Do more than just believe in Jesus Christ and His mission. Work to learn of Him in the scriptures, come to know Him through prayer, and continually use His power to repent and improve.
    Know God’s laws and live them. It’s the only way to obtain true happiness.
    Live the truth.
    Share the truth.
    Care for our bodies and our minds by observing principles set forth in the Word of Wisdom.

President Monson bore testimony that our Heavenly Father has much in store for us, even eternal life, if we live worthy of those blessings. Of our Heavenly Father’s plan for us he said, “It is the one perfect path to peace and happiness both here and in the world to come.”
